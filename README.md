## Data and analysis derived from the Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint Studies (CATSS) project

In the 1980s and 90s, Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint Studies (CATSS) was an active, NEH funded, research project, 
under the leadership of Robert Kraft (University of Pennsylvania) and Emanual Tov (Hebrew University).  History of the project and original
source data may be found on <a href='http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rak/catss.html'>the project home page</a>.

As a young graduate student at the University of Pennsylvania, I spent the summer of 1985 as a Greek morphologist, annotating word-by-word the parts of speech and declension  of several books of the Greek Septuagint (the earliest extant translation of the Hebrew Bible into Greek).  After leaving the academic study of religion and having enjoyed a 35 year career in software engineering and data science, I am drawn back to this research to apply modern natural language processing (NLP) algorithms, techniques, and tools to this amazing corpus.  

This is a work in progress.
