The materials on the accompanying diskettes are distributed by 
the Center for Computer Analysis of Texts (CCAT) at the 
University of Pennsylvania for the use of students, teachers and 
scholars in study and education contexts. They are not to be 
used, either directly or indirectly, for commercial purposes 
without prior written consent of the various legal authors and 
developers identified below. If copies are made and given to  
other persons for NON-COMMERCIAL use, those persons are also  
required to register with CCAT by completing the standard  
"User Declaration" (included as a separate file on the diskettes) and returning it to CCAT at the address indicated above. This is for  
legal and collaborative purposes only; no fees are involved.   
The CCAT repository contains a wide variety of materials obtained 
from various sources. The following are standard items for which 
requests are regularly received. It is expected that, in accord 
with normal scholarly etiquette, use of such materials in 
publications, etc., will be acknowledged appropriately. 


BHS = Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia, ed. K. Elliger and W. 
Rudolph (Stuttgart: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 1967/77). 
Copyright held by the German Bible Society, in cooperation with 
the United Bible Societies (UBS). 

Michigan-Claremont BHS = The computer text produced initially 
under the direction of H. Van Dyke Parunak (then at Univ. 
Michigan) and Richard E. Whitaker (representing the Claremont 
Grad. Schools), with funding from the David and Lucile Packard 
Foundation. Subsequent revisions and verification have been 
coordinated by Whitaker with input from a variety of sources and 
special support from the CATSS (Computer Assisted Tools for 
Septuagint Studies) Project and its teams at the Hebrew 
University (Jerusalem; under E. Tov) and at the Westminster 
Theological Seminary (Elkins Park, PA; under A. Groves) as well 
as at the University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia). An early 
form of the Michigan-Claremont text provided the basis for the 
MIKRAH version, which in turn was further improved through 
cooperation with the Bar Ilan (Israel) computer center and the 
Maredsous (Belgium) based Centre: Informatique et Bible (CIB) 
directed by R. F. Poswick. The Michigan-Claremont text also has 
been collated against the CIB text.  The latest revision (done at 
Westminster Seminary in July of 1987) corrected the text according  
to facsimiles of Codex Leningradensis. 

LXX = Septuaginta, ed. A. Rahlfs (Stuttgart: WŸrttembergische 
Bibelanstalt, 1935; repr. in 9th ed., 1971). 

VULG = Biblia Sacra Vulgata, ed. R. Weber and B. Fischer. (Stuttgart:  
Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, 1963; 4th ed., 1983). 

CATSS LXX = The computer form prepared by the TLG (Thesaurus 
Linguae Graecae) Project directed by T. Brunner at the University 
of California, Irvine, with further verification and adaptation 
(in process) by CATSS towards conformity with the individual 
Gšttingen editions that have appeared since 1935. 

GNT = The Greek New Testament, 3nd corrected ed., ed. K. Aland,  
M. Black, C. M. Martini, B. M. Metzger, and A. Wikgren (Stuttgart: 
WŸrttemberg Bible Society, 1983). Copyright is held by the 
United Bible Societies (UBS).  

PAR = Parallel Hebrew-Aramaic and Greek texts of Jewish 
Scripture, based on the Michigan-Claremont BHS consonantal text 
and the TLG LXX, created by the CATSS project under the direction 
of E. Tov (Jerusalem team). This data base currently is in a  
provisional form that will undergo continued modification as the  
CATSS project proceeds to its goals. Portions of PAR can be  
supplied by special arrangement.   

LXXM = The morphologically analyzed text of CATSS LXX prepared by CATSS under the direction of R. Kraft (Philadelphia team). 

BHSM = In the near future, the morphologically analyzed 
Michigan-Claremont BHS materials will also be released. 

GNTM = In the future, the morphologically analyzed 
United Bible Societies NT3 will also be released. 

LXXV = The CATSS LXX plus the textual variants as encoded from the apparatuses of the best available editions (especially 
Gšttingen, Cambridge), and reformatted for computer by the 
Philadelphia team of CATSS under the direction of R. Kraft. Only 
small portions of this data base are currently available. 


Programs and Fonts 
In the 1980s, we wrote programs and fonts appropriate for using the CCAT
files. However these programs are now (in 2005)  rather old.  The DOS (!)
programs are available here:
    http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/other/software/dos/ccatutil/    

Mac users can use Transcribe, which is available here:
    http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/other/software/mac/transcribe/
Transcribe runs in MacOS 9 or in Classic mode on MacOS X. 

We do not have Windows programs. All of our programs are offered 
on an as-is basis. They are no longer being developed.
