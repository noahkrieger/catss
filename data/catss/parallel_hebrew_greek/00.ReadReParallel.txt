THE PARALLEL ALIGNED DATABASE
A Brief Introduction
11/15/91

The Parallel Aligned Hebrew-Aramaic and Greek texts of Jewish
Scripture are based on the Michigan-Claremont BHS consonantal text
and the TLG LXX, created by the CATSS project under the direction
of E. Tov (Jerusalem team). This data base currently is in a 
provisional form that will undergo continued modification as the 
CATSS project proceeds to its goals. 

Each line of the parallel files shows equivalent elements of the MT
and the LXX.  Occasionally, the Hebrew column splits into two columns:
column a and column b.

Column a of the Hebrew records all elements of MT as formal
equivalents of the LXX.  This recording probably represents the most
objective way of registering the relation between the LXX and MT, but
at times it is of limited value since the Greek translation was
actually made from a different Hebrew text.  Column b refers to that
Hebrew text.

Column b contains a selection of retroverted readings, presumably
found in the parent text of the LXX.  At the same time, column b
contains some remarks on differences between the LXX and MT in matters
of translation technique.  In both matters no completeness is
attempted.
