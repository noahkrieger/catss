<h3>CATSS: TREATMENT OF THE GREEK TEXTUAL VARIANTS<au> </h3>
<p>Robert A. Kraft [html version 10mr2004]</p>
<p>Originally published as pp. 53-68 (section I.3) in <i><br>
  Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint Studies (CATSS). Volume 1: RUTH</i>.<br>

  Scholars Press, 1986)</p>
<p>One of the major goals of the CATSS project is to facilitate the encoding and 
  accessing of all significant textual variations in the Greek tradition. Ultimately, 
  this will include ancient versions and other secondary evidence (e.g. patristic 
  quotations) based on the Greek texts as well as newly discovered MS evidence. 
  Initially, however, the goal is to be able to access by computer the major published 
  apparatuses in the G&ouml;ttingen editions and, where there is no G&ouml;ttingen edition, 
  in the larger Cambridge Septuagint or the best available alternative (e.g. Margolis 
  for Joshua, Rahlfs' editio minor for Qohelet, Song, and 4 Maccabees). Insofar 
  as it is possible, the "main text" to which the variants are attached is the 
  best available eclectic text, which means G&ouml;ttingen where it exists, or Rahlfs' 
  short edition.</p>
   
<h4>1. Format of the Greek Textual File</h4>
<p>For purposes of the project, and in accord with efficient computer management 
  and utilization, it was decided to place each Greek word on a separate line 
  to the extent that this was practical. The Greek main text (Rahlfs' edition, 
  for Ruth) was first reformatted in that fashion as a "vertical text," and the 
  textual evidence (from the larger Cambridge edition, for Ruth) was reorganized 
  and integrated into the same format. This format allows for efficient searching 
  of the file, analysis of textual groupings, recreation of the main text or of 
  the consecutive text of particular witnesses and/or families, etc. Unfortunately, 
  this is not the conventional way in which published textual apparatuses are 
  presented, so a great deal of reorganization and innovation in formatting has 
  been required. </p>
<p> The resulting Greek file intersperses the main text (G&ouml;ttingen or [as with 
  Ruth] Rahlfs) with the textual variants rather than keeping text and apparatus 
  in separate blocks or files. For the "simple text and variant" files, the TLG 
  "beta code" conventions have been retained to indicate "locators" (book, chapter, 
  verse, etc.; see further below), with explicit chapter and verse numbers included; 
  these are easily identified by the occurrence of a tilde "~" in column 1, usually 
  followed by "x" (for chapter) and "y" (for verse). For the textual data itself, 
  if the line contains a main text entry ("lemma"), that will begin in column 
  1. If the line records a variant reading rather than a main text lemma, column 
  1 is blank and column(s) 2(-3) contain(s) the appropriate siglum for that variant 
  (see below). Thus it is a simple matter to recreate the main text by instructing 
  the computer to reproduce only the lines in which column 1 is not blank. If 
  a variant is associated with the main text lemma, the lemma (and any closely 
  related information about attestation) is followed immediately by a right bracket 
  (]); any witnesses that do not attest the lemma or an alternative reading ("minuses" 
  or "omissions") are noted to the right of the bracket, on the same line, prefixed 
  with the ">" sign; alternative readings are recorded on subsequent lines, as 
  are any additional materials ("pluses"). All Greek words, whether main text 
  or variants, include accents and breathings (except for undeclined proper names 
  and apparent nonsense readings). Punctuation is included as part of the main 
  text, and variations in punctuation between the main editions consulted are 
  also noted. </p>
<p>The detailed "file format" for any given line ("record") of this simple text 
  and variant file is as follows [note that fixed width spacing is assumed for 
  such records, not variable spacing]: </p>
<p>columns (spaces) beginning <br>
  from the left margin and <br>
  numbered horizontally &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1

  <br>
  along each line &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1234567890123456789012 
  (etc.) <br>
  <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; |&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
  | <br>
  1 = start of lemma (if any) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXX...]... 
  <br>
  2-3= sigla of variant (if any) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+: 
  <br>
  4 = start of variant (if any) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;XXX...

  ...(MSS)... <br>
</p>
<p>If there is a variant to the lemma that begins in column 1, the lemma is followed 
  by a squared right bracket (]).</p>
<p> The textual apparatus to the Greek Ruth was entered "by hand" over a period 
  of several weeks by R. A. Kraft and his graduate assistant, Benjamin Wright. 
  In deciphering the apparatus to the Cambridge edition of Brooke-McLean (there 
  is no G&ouml;ttingen edition of Ruth at present), an attempt was made to break it 
  up into single word entries and to insert those entries at the appropriate locations 
  in the sequence of the main text (Rahlfs) that had been purchased from the TLG. 
  This was intended as an experiment as well as an act of data entry, to alert 
  us to the sorts of problems that would be encountered in dealing with variants 
  in this novel manner. A few chapters of Genesis were also entered in the same 
  way. Subsequent encoding of the textual apparatuses has been done, at the initial 
  level, by means of automatic data entry on an "optical character reader" (OCR) 
  or "scanner" and reformatted afterwards by a series of computer programs. The 
  resulting files are then checked carefully "by hand" for completeness, correctness 
  and consistency. </p>
<p> For the book of Ruth, the lemma or main text is that of Rahlfs with the exception 
  that <g>KAI/GE</g> is treated as a single word (in accord with recent practice 
  following Barth&eacute;lemy's investigations) rather than as two words (as in 
  Rahlfs and older editions). The apparatus is from the larger Cambridge Septuagint 
  (ed. Brooke and McLean), adjusted to the main text of Rahlfs. For examples of 
  the adjustments involved see section 5 below for <g>KAI/GE</g> and section 11 
  for readings in which the main text of Rahlfs differs from that of Cambridge 
  (MS B). </p>
<h4>2. Explicit Full Locators (Book, Chapter, Verse, Item/Variant)</h4>
<p>The "simple" format described above may not suffice for many purposes in computer 
  assisted searching and sorting, where it may be important that each line have 
  a tag indicating its exact location in the file. With the CATSS materials, the 
  conventional chapter and verse locators in each book can be prefixed to each 
  line automatically by means of an appropriate software program (e.g. the CATSS 
  CONVERT utility). It may also be desirable to generate something similar to 
  the CATSS four column code (within parentheses), described below, to number 
  each distinct item (word, variant unit, punctuation mark) within the verse. 
  The four numbers within the parentheses are actually intended as two sets of 
  two numbers; the two leftmost numbers indicate the item itself while the two 
  rightmost numbers attach to any variant units within the item. Thus "0403" identifies 
  the 4th item in the verse and the 3rd alternative in that variant unit; "1400" 
  means the 14th item, for which there is no variant (note that item 14 may itself 
  be a "plus" reading); "2101" means an item (number 21) which is lacking in some 
  witnesses (thus 01, but there will not be a 2102 unless an alternative reading 
  also exists), or an item for which alternative readings exist (which are numbered 
  2102, etc.). Punctuation also receives an item number and if there is variant 
  punctuation, a variant number as well. </p>
<p> The format for such coding would introduce onto each line of the comprehensive 
  file an initial fifteen "columns" (spaces, characters) to indicate the exact 
  location of the particular item (book, chapter, verse, etc.). Thus column 1 
  of the "simple" format would become column 16 in the "explicit" format as follows: 
</p>
<p> columns (spaces) beginning <br>
  from the left margin and <br>
  numbered horizontally &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</p>
<p>For the sake of clarity, the examples that follow will employ the "explicit" 
  format. </p>
<h4>3. Quantitative Variation ("Pluses" and "Minuses") </h4>
<p>Few problems were encountered in the recording of "pluses" and "minuses" (quantitative 
  variants). It was decided to include on the same line as the lemma, after the 
  right square bracket (]), any notation that certain witnesses lacked that lemma, 
  using the conventional "greater than" symbol (>) to indicate the type of variation 
  and to introduce the textual witnesses containing the shorter text. For instances 
  in which some witnesses include additional material absent from the base text, 
  each "added" word was placed on a separate line preceded by the conventional 
  "plus" sign (+) and followed by the list of witnesses. The only inconvenience 
  of these procedures was that it became necessary to repeat for each entry the 
  list of witnesses attesting any ">" or "+" readings that were more than a single 
  word in length. In this connection, we decided to identify readings in which 
  three or more consecutive words were lacking by the appended notation (>3), 
  etc., and consecutive pluses that extend to four or more words by (+4), etc., 
  to aid persons who search the variant file for specific occurrences but cannot 
  see the surrounding context.</p>
<p> A somewhat more complicated problem was encountered in those instances in 
  which a "plus" reading in one witness is balanced by an alternative "plus" reading 
  in another (variant to a variant). Since it is important to know when such alternative 
  variants are encountered as well as what each particular variant may be, the 
  first entry of a "plus"-with-alternative(s) unit is prefixed with "+:" while 
  the subsequent alternatives to it are identified with the ":+" indicator. For 
  the numbering of such variation units, see I.3.2 above. </p>
<p>     
<p><b>"Praemittit (-unt)" Readings.</b> A special type of "plus" reading is material 
  that depends closely upon what follows it to form a sense unit. Although the 
  textcritical convention normally used to identify such material is "pr," an 
  attempt was made to be clear as to the type of variation involved and to avoid 
  confusion in the choice of sigla ("pr" could also designate two manuscripts 
  in the Cambridge system); thus such readings are treated as a "+" followed by 
  the symbol for "less than" (<). Where a string of several words form a longer 
  text of the "pr" type, the designation "+<" normally introduces only the first 
  word of the string. When a "pr" type variant entry itself has one or more alternative 
  variations linked to it, the alternatives are indicated by the usual ":+" symbol 
  combination (see above) since it would be necessary to examine the immediately 
  preceding lines in the variant file to understand the entire variation unit 
  in any event.</p>
<p><b>"Transposed" Material (Inversions).</b> Although "transpositions" are not 
  really quantitative variations insofar as the total length of the context in 
  which they occur may not be affected, they can be handled effectively as a balanced 
  set of "minus" and "plus" readings. Thus in the notation used in the project, 
  the siglum ">" accompanied on the same line by "(~)" indicates a "transposition" 
  and will be balanced in the surrounding context by a line on which the "+" is 
  accompanied by "(~)" for the same textual witnesses. For example, when the order 
  of words in the main text (m) is 123456 but a variant text (v) has the order 
  563412, the notation will contain ten lines as follows: 
<p>
<p> 1 m] &gt; v(~) <br>
  2 m] &gt; v(~) <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 5 v(~) <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 6 v(~) <br>
  3 mv <br>
  4 mv <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 1 v(~) <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+ 2 v(~) <br>
  5 m] &gt; v(~) <br>
  6 m] &gt; v(~) <br>
</p>
<p>If a computer search is made of the readings in v, it will be noted immediately 
  that the apparent "omission" of 1-2 is balanced by the apparent "addition" of 
  the same elements later. Other variants involving the same body of text will 
  also be included alongside the transposed material. Thus it is possible to handle 
  this sort of variation consistently and effectively within the framework of 
  the desired one-variant-word-per-line format.</p>
<h4>4. Qualitative Variations (Substitutions/Alternatives) </h4>
<p> When some witnesses have an alternative reading to what is in the main text, 
  this is preceded by a colon (:) and followed by a list of the pertinent witnesses. 
  If the alternative reading is itself part of a "plus" text, the first affected 
  entry is preceded by "+:" (or "+<" for a "pr" type "plus") and the alternatives 
  by ":+". The numbering of the item within the verse (in parentheses after the 
  chapter and verse numbers) is identical in the first two columns for all members 
  of a substitution variant unit, while the lemma text itself is numbered 01 in 
  the last two columns and each of the alternatives is numbered 02, 03, etc. (see 
  further above, I.3.2). </p>
<h4>5. Special Problem: One Word / Two Word Variants</h4>
<p> In some passages, the variant cannot easily be reduced to a single Greek word 
  without compromising the basic sequence or the principles on which the file 
  has been formatted. This is especially true when the Greek permits crasis, the 
  joining of two words such as <g>KAI/</g> and <g>E)GW/</g> into the single form 
  <g>KA)GW/</g>, but obtains as well in other instances where an analogous situation 
  is attested in the textual witnesses. The following examples are instructive: 
</p>
<p> <br>
  RT 01 12(1001) &lt;gk&gt;DIO/TI&lt;/gk&gt;] <br>
  RT 01 12(1002) &nbsp;: &lt;gk&gt;DH\&lt;/gk&gt; b(+&lt;gk&gt;O(/TI&lt;/gk&gt;) 
  <br>
  RT 01 12(1003) &nbsp;: &lt;gk&gt;DIA/&lt;/gk&gt; MNdefhijmrsuyb2 OL <br>
  RT 01 12(1100)&nbsp; + &lt;gk&gt;TOU=TO&lt;/gk&gt; MNdefhijmrsuyb2 OL <br>
  RT 01 12(1200)&nbsp; + &lt;gk&gt;O(/TI&lt;/gk&gt; MNbdefhijmrsuvyb2 OL Thdt 
  <br>
</p>
<p>Note that the elements <g>DI, DH</g> and <g>DIA</g> are true variants, but 
  that <g>OTI</g> must also be treated as a "plus" in some witnesses insofar as 
  <g>TOUTO</g> separates it from the <g>DI</g>/<g>DIA</g> element (the similarity 
  of MS b to the MNdef, etc., grouping is apparently coincidental here since MS 
  b really reads <g>DH OTI</g> without an intervening <g>TOUTO</g>). </p>
<p>RT 02 09(3000) &lt;gk&gt;KAI\&lt;/gk&gt; <br>
  RT 02 09(3101) &lt;gk&gt;O(/&lt;/gk&gt; .. ] <br>
  RT 02 09(3201) &lt;gk&gt;TI&lt;/gk&gt;] <br>

  RT 02 09(3204) &nbsp;: ubi OS <br>
  RT 02 09(3205) &nbsp;: si OC OL <br>
</p>
<p>The two dots after <g>O(/</g> signify that the minimal variant unit here is 
  <g>O(/ TI,</g> and the alternatives listed after <g>TI</g> in actuality relate 
  to both words (<g>O(/ TI</g>), not simply to <g>TI</g>. </p>
<p>RT 03 04(0100) &lt;gk&gt;KAI\&lt;/gk&gt; <br>

  RT 03 04(0500) &lt;gk&gt;KOIMHQH=NAI&lt;/gk&gt; <br>
</p>
<p>Here, MS 30 lacks the words <g>E)N TW=|</g> and has in their place the word 
  <g>O(/TAN</g>. This could be treated as a ">" with a "+" or (as we have done; 
  note the ".." joiner) as a one-for-two substitution. </p>
<p>RT 04 04(0101) &lt;gk&gt;KA)GW\&lt;/gk&gt;] &gt; b2 <br>

  RT 04 04(0302) &nbsp;: &lt;gk&gt;EI)=PON&lt;/gk&gt; glnoe2 <br>
</p>
<p>Here is a blatant two-for-one variation, treated somewhat 
artificially as a substitution and a "+" joined by "..".

</p>
<p>Here the complexity of possible readings, when OA and OL are considered, suggests 
  that the ":" with "+" may be a more useful approach. </p>
<p>RT 04 04(5700) &nbsp;+&lt;et OA-codd OE OL <br>
  RT 04 04(5801) &lt;gk&gt;O(&lt;/gk&gt;] &gt; 30 (see below) OA-ed(&gt;3) OA-codd(&gt;5)

  <br>
</p>
<p>The situation is complex: where most MSS have <g>O( DE/,</g> MS 30 has a two-for-one 
  reading <g>W(=DE</g> but OL has et ille (<g>KAI\ O(</g> ?).</p>
<p> Finally, in the two-for-one (or one-for-two) category, the treatment of <g>KAI/GE</g> 
  should be noted. In accord with recent convention on this matter (relating especially 
  to Barth&eacute;lemy's research), we have modified earlier practice (including Rahlfs' 
  text) to read <g>KAI/GE</g> as one word rather than two. This policy sometimes 
  affects the treatment of variants as well: </p>

  RT 01 12(2803) &nbsp;: &lt;gk&gt;KAI/GE&lt;/gk&gt; `a'(b) <br>
  <br>
  Here it would also be possible to treat the variants as &quot;&gt;&quot; and 
  &quot;+&quot;. </p>

<p>As with 03 12 (above), probably the <g>H(</g> in MS c is an alternative to 
  the <g>GE</g>. In this instance, the apparatus has left the two words of MS 
  c together. </p>
<h4>6. Orthography </h4>
<p> There has been no attempt to reproduce the first apparatus in the Cambridge 
  edition, which lists orthographic differences between the major uncials. Such 
  material can be added at any time, as a subset of "qualitative variations," 
  by using the same coding. In fact, numerous orthographic variations are included 
  in the material for the book of Ruth in the various treatments of certain proper 
  names -- <g>*NWEMEIN</g> is an obvious example (see also section 11 below). 
</p>
<h4>7. Punctuation </h4>
<p> With much hesitation, it was decided to include punctuation on its own line 
  as a separate record, and to note differences in punctuation between the base 
  text (for Ruth, Rahlfs) and the source of variants (for Ruth, Cambridge). Where 
  the G&ouml;ttingen edition will be used for both base text and variants, differences 
  in punctuation in Rahlfs may be noted.</p>
<h4>8. Attestation (Manuscripts and Other Witnesses) </h4>
<p> Normally, lists of witnesses are provided only for the deviations from the 
  main text. In some instances, however, attestation (in part or in whole) for 
  the lemma may also be included. These situations depend on the policy of the 
  apparatus from which the material came, except for instances in which the Cambridge 
  apparatus is being used and Rahlfs' main text differs from the Cambridge reading 
  (MS B). When MS B is relocated as a variant and a Cambridge variant becomes 
  the lemma text (in agreement with Rahlfs), attestation for the new main text 
  (Rahlfs) will be listed from the Cambridge apparatus, along with whatever other 
  information is available there. See section 11 below for examples. 
<p><b> Default Attestation ("omn", "rell" or "rel").</b> For the Cambridge apparatus, 
  which is based on a relatively small number of representative manuscripts, the 
  manuscript designations included in the default attestation "omn" and "rell" 
  or covered by such listings as "a-d" (= abcd) have been filled out explicitly 
  in the project file. Different procedures may be required with the G&ouml;ttingen 
  apparatuses, which cover a much larger range of MSS. 
<p>
<p><b>Versional Evidence.</b> For the present, we have attempted to reproduce 
  the versional information found in the respective apparatuses consulted. This 
  material requires especially close scrutiny and will need extensive modification 
  sometime in the future. The Cambridge editors tended to supply relatively full 
  information for the Old Latin (OL), Syro-hexapla (OS), Armenian (OA) and Palestinian 
  Aramaic (OP) versions. They were more selective with the Ethiopic (OE) and Coptic 
  (OC) materials. In the Ruth variant file, the OL spelling as found in the Cambridge 
  edition is sometimes standardized by use of parentheses (to fill in letters), 
  OS transliterations follow the Hebrew coding employed by the project, and relatively 
  certain Greek retroversions are sometimes noted in parentheses. More satisfactory 
  treatment of most of the versional material, however, must await the results 
  of specific studies (with computer assistance?) on each of the versions.
<p><b> Quotations and Other Secondary Witnesses.</b> For the present the information 
  in the source apparatus attesting patristic quotations and related material 
  is simply reproduced. As with the versions, much work needs to be done before 
  this type of evidence can be evaluated adequately. The advent of computer assisted 
  research encourages us to look for greater progress in these areas in the near 
  future. 
<p>
<p><b>Other Ancient Greek Versions ("the Three," etc.).</b> The format constructed 
  for the project is sufficiently flexible to accommodate the inclusion of all 
  ancient Greek variants, from whatever source. Thus we have not attempted to 
  devise a separate apparatus for "the Three" (Theodotion, Aquila, Symmachus) 
  and similar materials. Instead, the apostrophe (') is used to indicate these 
  materials, enclosing the source designation on both sides ('t', 'a', 's', etc.) 
  and the witness from which the information derives. A computer search of the 
  file for any of these distinctive elements will enable the user to create an 
  apparatus of these materials.</p>
<h4>9. Indicators of Uncertainty (&quot;vid&quot;, &quot;see&quot;, &quot;?&quot;)</h4>
<p> The apparatus reproduces the "vid" (= "apparently," but with room for doubt) 
  notations in the Cambridge apparatus, but also adds other indicators of uncertainty: 
  "see" is usually a term of cross reference and occurs especially in connection 
  with versional material that has been broken into smaller units and often requires 
  a consideration of the fuller versional context in order to determine what versional 
  word(s) aligns with the Greek word; "?" is most often attached to a suggested 
  reconstruction of versional material into Greek and warns the user that this 
  is simply a suggestion (it is sometimes combined with "see" in such contexts). 
  When "(?)" follows a MS designation, it simply reproduces the notation in the 
  Cambridge apparatus; when it follows a versional siglum (OA, OC, OE, OL, OS), 
  it usually is a warning to check the variant context carefully. In general, 
  in these and in other occurrences, "?" is used as an indicator of doubt.</p>
