<h3>Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagintal Studies: Variants Module</h3>
<p>Information <a href="#reports">update</a> 03 May 2007 (site
reorganization May 2005), Robert A. Kraft, module director.</p>
<p>These notes need further refinement, but provide a starting point
for understanding what has been done and who has been involved. Basic
information on the variants project and its procedures are available in
the <a
 href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/text/religion/biblical/lxxvar/0-Explan.htm">
1986 article</a> describing the work on RUTH (from the Cambridge larger
Septuagint edition); these instructions are being updated to include
more recent work based on Go%ttingen editions. (See the IOSCS page for
a list of <a href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/ioscs/editions.html">
recommended critical editions</a>.) These materials began to be made
available on the CCAT gopher in June 1994. Much of the most recent work
on the texts that were encoded previously involves reformatting into an
HTML type coding and adjusting to show <a
 href="http://www.angelfire.com/pa5/cjmlxxvariants/">Unicode Greek</a> (by Christopher
McCartney), as well as checking for accuracy. The remaining texts are
also still awaiting encoding, as noted below. Ultimately, all files
will need to be adjusted for consistency.</p>
<p>If you have problems displaying the information, see the possible <a
 href="http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/gopher/text/religion/biblical/lxxvar/new/0_about_the_files">solution</a>
proposed by Jay Treat [a member of the project staff since 1989]. </p>
<p>General staff members (not including individual assignments listed
below) have included Jackie Pastis, David Rech [especially scanning],
Ben Dunning [1995], Gil Renberg [1995-2004], Patrick George [c 1995],
Alan Lowenschuss [1995-96], William (Chip) Gruen [from 7/2000-2003],
Justin Dombrowski [2003-2004], Moises Bassan [2004], Hunter Powell
[from 6/2004], Chris McCartney [from 5/2005; see his <a
 href="http://www.angelfire.com/pa5/cjmlxxvariants/">unicode files</a>],
Michael Francis [from 5/2005], Virginia Wayland [from 5/2005], and
Sigrid Peterson (from 12/2006). </p>
<p>For the sequence numbers, we have arbitrarily chosen a modified and expanded version of the order in codex Vaticanus (moving  Esther, Judith and Tobit right after 1-2 Esdras), and including the 4 books of Maccabees (24-24; see codex Sinaiticus and Alexandrinus), Psalms of Solomon (37; see Alexandrinus), and the Prayer of Manasseh (65). Where the numbering is unusual (e.g. two numbers for Isaiah, etc.), it reflects an attempt to be consistent with the Morphologically Analyzed files, which were numbered first. [Note that the Parallel Text numbering differs, since several of the Greek books do not exist in Hebrew or Aramaic; this will need to be made more consistent at some point.] </p>

<ul>
  <li>01 <a href="1Pentateuch/01Gen.html"> Genesis</a> (scanned 1994,
  edited under the direction of Fritz Knobloch 1995-2000) -- will need
  minor adjustments in the interests of consistency -- transferred to
  HTML and Unicode Greek by Chris McCartney (Nov 2005). <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Enumeration
  is in the form #02 05 (chapter verse); makes Search and Replace (S&amp;R) of enumeration in longer
  books go much faster than enumeration as e.g. 2.5 or 15.15 or 25.25.
  Why are there 4 files of Genesis? Why not simply 01Gen.html and
  01Gen-beta.txt? Needs
  rubrication of numbers and italicizing, subscripting and superscripting. </span>The Introduction to the Goettingen edition has been translated into English by the author, John Wevers, and is now <a href="1Pentateuch/01Gen-Wevers-Intro.html">online</a> with the variant files. We hope to update it periodically.<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
  </span></li>
  <li>02 Exodus (scanned 1994; to Jim Blankenship 1/1995 -- still at work
5/2005) -- nothing yet on file. <span style="font-weight: bold;">No
news as of 2/07.</span> The Introduction to the Goettingen edition has been translated into English by the author, John Wevers, and is now <a href="1Pentateuch/02Exod-Wevers-Intro.html">online</a> with the variant files. We hope to update it periodically. <br>

  Powell is currently working on this material. He reports, in Jan. 2007,
  being "nearly complete" with Chapters 1,2,19,20, and 21; he wants to
  double check these, and go on to 22-25, to be completed by summer 2007.

  <li>04 <a href="1Pentateuch/04Num.html">Numbers</a> (Patrick George
  partial files 9/29/1997; Gil Renberg completed it by 1/1999) --
  transferred to HTML and Unicode Greek by Chris McCartney (Nov 2005). <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">The
  Unicode Greek file has complete text, and is in the 01 Pentateuch
  Folder.There is a strange sequence at the beginning that requires
  interpretation and editing. Also needed are italics/Latin and
  rubrication S&amp;R, as well as superscripting and subscripting.
