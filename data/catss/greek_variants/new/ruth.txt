<ta>CATSS: TREATMENT OF THE GREEK TEXTUAL VARIANTS</> 
<au>Robert A. Kraft</> 
 
     One of the major goals of the CATSS project is to facilitate 
the encoding and accessing of all significant textual variations 
in the Greek tradition. Ultimately, this will include ancient 
versions and other secondary evidence (e.g. patristic quotations) 
based on the Greek texts as well as newly discovered MS 
evidence. Initially, however, the goal is to be able to access 
by computer the major published apparatuses in the Go%ttingen 
editions and, where there is no Go%ttingen edition, in the larger 
Cambridge Septuagint or the best available alternative (e.g. 
Margolis for Joshua, Rahlfs' editio minor for Qohelet, Song, and 
4 Maccabees). Insofar as it is possible, the "main text" to which 
the variants are attached is the best available eclectic text, 
which means Goettingen where it exists, or Rahlfs' short edition. 
 
 
<h1>1. Format of the Greek Textual File</> 
 
     For purposes of the project, and in accord with efficient 
computer management and utilization, it was decided to place each 
Greek word on a separate line to the extent that this was 
practical. The Greek main text (Rahlfs' edition, for Ruth) was 
first reformatted in that fashion as a "vertical text," and the 
textual evidence (from the larger Cambridge edition, for Ruth) 
was reorganized and integrated into the same format. This format 
allows for efficient searching of the file, analysis of textual 
groupings, recreation of the main text or of the consecutive text 
of particular witnesses and/or families, etc. Unfortunately, this 
is not the conventional way in which published textual 
apparatuses are presented, so a great deal of reorganization and 
innovation in formatting has been required. 

     The resulting Greek file intersperses the main text 
(Go%ttingen or [as with Ruth] Rahlfs) with the textual variants 
rather than keeping text and apparatus in separate blocks or 
files. For the "simple text and variant" files, the TLG "beta 
code" conventions have been retained to indicate "locators" 
(book, chapter, verse, etc.; see further below), with explicit 
chapter and verse numbers included; these are easily identified 
by the occurrence of a tilde "~" in column 1, usually followed by 
"x" (for chapter) and "y" (for verse). For the textual data 
itself, if the line contains a main text entry ("lemma"), that 
will begin in column 1. If the line records a variant reading 
rather than a main text lemma, column 1 is blank and column(s) 
2(-3) contain(s) the appropriate siglum for that variant (see 
below). Thus it is a simple matter to recreate the main text by 
instructing the computer to reproduce only the lines in which 
column 1 is not blank. If a variant is associated with the main 
text lemma, the lemma (and any closely related information about 
attestation) is followed immediately by a right bracket (]); any 
witnesses that do not attest the lemma or an alternative reading 
("minuses" or "omissions") are noted to the right of the bracket, 
on the same line, prefixed with the ">" sign; alternative 
readings are recorded on subsequent lines, as are any additional 
materials ("pluses"). All Greek words, whether main text or 
variants, include accents and breathings (except for undeclined 
proper names and apparent nonsense readings). Punctuation is 
included as part of the main text, and variations in punctuation 
between the main editions consulted are also noted. 
 
     The detailed "file format" for any given line ("record") of 
this simple text and variant file is as follows: 
 
  columns (spaces) beginning 
  from the left margin and 
  numbered horizontally                     1         2    
  along each line                  1234567890123456789012 (etc.)  
  
                                   |  |  |  | |   | 
  1  = start of lemma (if any)     XXX...]...  
  2-3= sigla of variant (if any)    +: 
  4  = start of variant (if any)      XXX... 
  ...= textual attestation               ...(MSS)... 
 
If there is a variant to the lemma that begins in column 1, the 
lemma is followed by a squared right bracket (]). 

     The textual apparatus to the Greek Ruth was entered "by 
hand" over a period of several weeks by R. A. Kraft and his 
graduate assistant, Benjamin Wright. In deciphering the apparatus 
to the Cambridge edition of Brooke-McLean (there is no Go%ttingen 
edition of Ruth at present), an attempt was made to break it up 
into single word entries and to insert those entries at the 
appropriate locations in the sequence of the main text (Rahlfs) 
that had been purchased from the TLG. This was intended as an 
experiment as well as an act of data entry, to alert us to the 
sorts of problems that would be encountered in dealing with 
variants in this novel manner. A few chapters of Genesis were 
also entered in the same way. Subsequent encoding of the textual 
apparatuses has been done, at the initial level, by means of 
automatic data entry on an "optical character reader" (OCR) or 
"scanner" and reformatted afterwards by a series of computer 
programs. The resulting files are then checked carefully "by 
hand" for completeness, correctness and consistency. 

     For the book of Ruth, the lemma or main text is that of 
Rahlfs with the exception that <g>KAI/GE</g> is treated as a 
single word (in accord with recent practice following 
Barthe/lemy's investigations) rather than as two words (as in 
Rahlfs and older editions). The apparatus is from the larger 
Cambridge Septuagint (ed. Brooke and McLean), adjusted to the 
main text of Rahlfs. For examples of the adjustments involved see 
below, I.3.5 for <g>KAI/GE</g> and I.3.11 for readings in which 
the main text of Rahlfs differs from that of Cambridge (MS B). 
 
 
<h1>2. Full Locators (Book, Chapter, Verse, Item/Variant) 

     The "simple" format described above may not suffice for many 
purposes in computer assisted searching and sorting, where it 
may be important that each line have a tag indicating its exact 
location in the file. With the CATSS materials, the conventional 
chapter and verse locators in each book can be prefixed to each 
line automatically by means of an appropriate software program 
(e.g. the CATSS CONVERT utility). It may also be desirable to 
generate something similar to the CATSS four column code (within 
parentheses), described below, to number each distinct item 
(word, variant unit, punctuation mark) within the verse. The four 
numbers within the parentheses are actually intended as two sets 
of two numbers; the two leftmost numbers indicate the item itself 
while the two rightmost numbers attach to any variant units 
within the item. Thus "0403" identifies the 4th item in the verse 
and the 3rd alternative in that variant unit; "1400" means the 
14th item, for which there is no variant (note that item 14 may 
itself be a "plus" reading); "2101" means an item (number 21) 
which is lacking in some witnesses (thus 01, but there will not 
be a 2102 unless an alternative reading also exists), or an item 
for which alternative readings exist (which are numbered 2102, 
etc.). Punctuation also receives an item number and if there is 
variant punctuation, a variant number as well. 
 
     The format for such coding would introduce onto each line of 
the comprehensive file an initial fifteen "columns" (spaces, 
characters) to indicate the exact location of the particular item 
(book, chapter, verse, etc.). Thus column 1 of the "simple" 
format would become column 16 in the "explicit" format as 
follows:

  columns (spaces) beginning 
  from the left margin and 
  numbered horizontally              1         2         3 
  along each line           12345678901234567890123456789012 (etc.)  
  
                            |  |  |  | |   | 
   1-2 = book (abbrev.)     RT |  |  | |   | 
   4-5 = chapter               03 |  | |   | 
   7-8 = verse                    05 | |   | 
  10-11= (item                      (06|   | 
  12-13=  variation)                   02) | 
  16   = start of lemma (if any)           XXX...]...  
  17-18= sigla of variant (if any)          +: 
  19   = start of variant (if any)            XXX... 
  ...  = textual attestation                     ...(MSS)... 
 
For the sake of clarity, the examples that follow will employ the 
"explicit" format.

 
<h1>3. Quantitative Variation ("Pluses" and "Minuses")</> 
 
     Few problems were encountered in the recording of "pluses" 
and "minuses" (quantitative variants). It was decided to include 
on the same line as the lemma, after the right square bracket 
(]), any notation that certain witnesses lacked that lemma, using 
the conventional "greater than" symbol (>) to indicate the type 
of variation and to introduce the textual witnesses containing 
the shorter text. For instances in which some witnesses include 
additional material absent from the base text, each "added" word 
was placed on a separate line preceded by the conventional "plus" 
sign (+) and followed by the list of witnesses. The only 
inconvenience of these procedures was that it became necessary to 
repeat for each entry the list of witnesses attesting any ">" or 
"+" readings that were more than a single word in length. In this 
connection, we decided to identify readings in which three or 
more consecutive words were lacking by the appended notation 
(>3), etc., and consecutive pluses that extend to four or more 
words by (+4), etc., to aid persons who search the variant file 
for specific occurrences but cannot see the surrounding context. 

     A somewhat more complicated problem was encountered in those 
instances in which a "plus" reading in one witness is balanced by 
an alternative "plus" reading in another (variant to a variant). 
Since it is important to know when such alternative variants are 
encountered as well as what each particular variant may be, the 
first entry of a "plus"-with-alternative(s) unit is prefixed with 
"+:" while the subsequent alternatives to it are identified with 
the ":+" indicator. For the numbering of such variation units, 
see I.3.2 above. 

     <h2>"Praemittit (-unt)" Readings.</> A special type of 
"plus" reading is material that depends closely upon what 
follows it to form a sense unit. Although the textcritical 
convention normally used to identify such material is "pr," an 
attempt was made to be clear as to the type of variation 
involved and to avoid confusion in the choice of sigla ("pr" 
could also designate two manuscripts in the Cambridge system); 
thus such readings are treated as a "+" followed by the symbol 
for "less than" (<). Where a string of several words form a 
longer text of the "pr" type, the designation "+<" normally 
introduces only the first word of the string. When a "pr" type 
variant entry itself has one or more alternative variations 
linked to it, the alternatives are indicated by the usual ":+" 
symbol combination (see above) since it would be necessary to 
examine the immediately preceding lines in the variant file to 
understand the entire variation unit in any event. 

     <h2>"Transposed" Material (Inversions).</> Although 
"transpositions" are not really quantitative variations insofar 
as the total length of the context in which they occur may not be 
affected, they can be handled effectively as a balanced set of 
"minus" and "plus" readings. Thus in the notation used in the 
project, the siglum ">" accompanied on the same line by "(~)" 
indicates a "transposition" and will be balanced in the 
surrounding context by a line on which the "+" is accompanied by 
"(~)" for the same textual witnesses. For example, when the order 
of words in the main text (m) is 123456 but a variant text (v) 
has the order 563412, the notation will contain ten lines as 
follows: 
 
  1 m] > v(~) 
  2 m] > v(~) 
     + 5 v(~) 
     + 6 v(~) 
  3 mv 
  4 mv 
     + 1 v(~) 
     + 2 v(~) 
  5 m] > v(~) 
  6 m] > v(~) 
 
If a computer search is made of the readings in v, it will be 
noted immediately that the apparent "omission" of 1-2 is balanced 
by the apparent "addition" of the same elements later. Other 
variants involving the same body of text will also be included 
alongside the transposed material. Thus it is possible to handle 
this sort of variation consistently and effectively within the 
framework of the desired one-variant-word-per-line format. 
 
 
<h1>4. Qualitative Variations (Substitutions/Alternatives)</> 
 
     When some witnesses have an alternative reading to what is 
in the main text, this is preceded by a colon (:) and followed by 
a list of the pertinent witnesses. If the alternative reading is 
itself part of a "plus" text, the first affected entry is 
preceded by "+:" (or "+<" for a "pr" type "plus") and the 
alternatives by ":+". The numbering of the item within the verse 
(in parentheses after the chapter and verse numbers) is identical 
in the first two columns for all members of a substitution 
variant unit, while the lemma text itself is numbered 01 in the 
last two columns and each of the alternatives is numbered 02, 03, 
etc. (see further above, I.3.2). 
 
 
<h1>5. Special Problem: One Word / Two Word Variants</> 
 
     In some passages, the variant cannot easily be reduced to a 
single Greek word without compromising the basic sequence or the 
principles on which the file has been formatted. This is 
especially true when the Greek permits crasis, the joining of two 
words such as <g>KAI/</g> and <g>E)GW/</g> into one 
(<g>KA)GW/</g>), but obtains as well in other instances where an 
analogous situation is attested in the textual witnesses. The 
following examples are instructive: 
 
RT 01 12(1001) <g>DIO/TI] 
RT 01 12(1002)  : <g>DH\</g> b(+<g>O(/TI</g>) 
RT 01 12(1003)  : <g>DIA/</g> MNdefhijmrsuyb2 OL 
RT 01 12(1100)  + <g>TOU=TO</g> MNdefhijmrsuyb2 OL 
RT 01 12(1200)  +<<g>O(/TI</g> MNbdefhijmrsuvyb2 OL Thdt 
 
Note that the elements <g>DI, DH</g> and <g>DIA</g> are true 
variants, but that <g>OTI</g> must also be treated as a "plus" in 
some witnesses insofar as <g>TOUTO</g> separates it from the 
<g>DI</g>/<g>DIA</g> element (the similarity of MS b to the 
MNdef, etc., grouping is apparently coincidental here since MS b 
really reads <g>DH OTI</g> without an intervening <g>TOUTO</g>). 
 
RT 02 09(3000) <g>KAI\</g> 
RT 02 09(3101) <g>O(/</g> .. ] 
RT 02 09(3201) <g>TI</g>] 
RT 02 09(3202)  : <g>O(/TE</g> abdefjlqw 
RT 02 09(3203)  : <g>O(PO/TE</g> MNhikmprtuvb2 
RT 02 09(3204)  : ubi OS 
RT 02 09(3205)  : si OC OL 
 
The two dots after <g>O(/</g> signify that the minimal variant 
unit here is <g>O(/ TI,</g> and the alternatives listed after 
<g>TI</g> in actuality relate to both words (<g>O(/ TI</g>), not 
simply to <g>TI</g>. 
 
RT 03 04(0100) <g>KAI\</g> 
RT 03 04(0201) <g>E)/STAI</g>] > OC OE 
RT 03 04(0301) <g>E)N</g> .. ] 
RT 03 04(0401) <g>TW=|</g>] 
RT 03 04(0402)  : <g>O(/TAN</g> 30 
RT 03 04(0500) <g>KOIMHQH=NAI</g> 
 
Here, MS 30 lacks the words <g>E)N TW=|</g> and has in their 
place the word <g>O(/TAN</g>. This could be treated as a ">" with 
a "+" or (as we have done; note the ".." joiner) as a one-for-two 
substitution. 
 
RT 04 04(0101) <g>KA)GW\</g>] > b2 
RT 04 04(0102)  : <g>KAI\</g> .. aglnoptva2e2 
RT 04 04(0200)  + <g>E)GW\</g> aglnoptva2e2 
RT 04 04(0301) <g>EI)=PA</g>] > ptvb2 
RT 04 04(0302)  : <g>EI)=PON</g> glnoe2 
 
Here is a blatant two-for-one variation, treated somewhat 
artificially as a substitution and a "+" joined by "..". 
 
RT 04 04(5101) <g>KA)GW/</g> ABabmxa2] > OL(ego) 
RT 04 04(5102)  : <g>KAI\</g> .. MNcdefghijklmopqrstuvb2e2 
RT 04 04(5103)  : et [post te ego sum] OA-ed 
RT 04 04(5200)  + <g>E)GW/</g> MNcdefghijklmopqrstuvb2e2 OL 
RT 04 04(5301) <g>EI)MI</g>] > OA-ed 
 
Here the complexity of possible readings, when OA and OL are 
considered, suggests that the ":" with "+" may be a more useful 
approach. 
 
RT 04 04(5700)  +<et OA-codd OE OL 
RT 04 04(5801) <g>O(] > 30</g>(see below) OA-ed(>3) OA-codd(>5) (see OE) 
RT 04 04(5802)  : ille OL 
RT 04 04(5901) <g>DE\</g>] > OA-ed(>3) OA-codd(>5) OE OL 
RT 04 04(5902)  : <g>W(=DE 30</g>(see above) 
RT 04 04(6000)  +<<g>KAI\</g> 30 
RT 04 04(6101) <g>EI)=PEN</g>] > OA-ed(>3) OA-codd(>5) 
 
The situation is complex: where most MSS have <g>O( DE/,</g> MS 
30 has a two-for-one reading <g>W(=DE</g> but OL has et ille 
(<g>KAI\ O(</g> ?). 

     Finally, in the two-for-one (or one-for-two) category, the 
treatment of <g>KAI/GE</g> should be noted. In accord with recent 
convention on this matter (relating especially to Barthe/lemy's 
research), we have modified earlier practice (including Rahlfs' 
text) to read <g>KAI/GE</g> as one word rather than two. This 
policy sometimes affects the treatment of variants as well: 
 
RT 01 05(0501) <g>KAI/GE</g>] > Akptv 18(~) OA OC OE OL 
 
RT 01 12(2801) <g>TOU=</g>] 
RT 01 12(2802)  : <g>KAI\</g> MN*hyb2 71 OA `?'(k) 
RT 01 12(2803)  : <g>KAI/GE</g> `a'(b) 
 
Here it would also be possible to treat the variants as ">" and 
"+". 
 
RT 02 16(0501) <g>KAI/GE</g>] > OL(>4) 
RT 02 16(0502)  : <g>KAI\</g> gklnowa2e2 OA OC 
 
RT 03 12(1801) <g>KAI/GE] 
RT 03 12(1802)  : <g>KAI\</g> hkmw 
RT 03 12(1900)  + <g>EI)</g> k 
RT 03 12(2000)  + <g>O(/TI</g> w 
RT 03 12(2100)  + quod(<g>TI?</g>) OS 
RT 03 12(2200)  + sed OL 
 
Probably the <g>EI)</g> in MS k represents the <g>GE</g> of 
<g>KAI/GE,</g> and perhaps a similar explanation obtains for OS. 
The apparatus in its present form does not attempt to adjudicate 
this matter. 
 
RT 04 10(0101) <g>KAI/GE</g>] > dkr OE OL(>14) 
RT 04 10(0102)  : <g>KAI\ H(</g> c 
 
As with 03 12 (above), probably the <g>H(</g> in MS c is an 
alternative to the <g>GE</g>. In this instance, the apparatus has 
left the two words of MS c together. 
 
 
<h1>6. Orthography</> 
 
     There has been no attempt to reproduce the first apparatus 
in the Cambridge edition, which lists orthographic differences 
between the major uncials. Such material can be added at any 
time, as a subset of "qualitative variations," by using the same 
coding. In fact, numerous orthographic variations are included in 
the material for the book of Ruth in the various treatments of 
certain proper names -- <g>*NWEMEIN</g> is an obvious example 
(see also I.3.11 below). 
 
 
<h1>7. Punctuation</> 
 
     With much hesitation, it was decided to include punctuation 
on its own line as a separate record, and to note differences in 
punctuation between the base text (for Ruth, Rahlfs) and the 
source of variants (for Ruth, Cambridge). Where the Go%ttingen 
edition will be used for both base text and variants, differences 
in punctuation in Rahlfs may be noted. 
 
 
<h1>8. Attestation (Manuscripts and Other Witnesses)</> 
 
     Normally, lists of witnesses are provided only for the 
deviations from the main text. In some instances, however, 
attestation (in part or in whole) for the lemma may also be 
included. These situations depend on the policy of the apparatus 
from which the material came, except for instances in which the 
Cambridge apparatus is being used and Rahlfs' main text differs 
from the Cambridge reading (MS B). When MS B is relocated as a 
variant and a Cambridge variant becomes the lemma text (in 
agreement with Rahlfs), attestation for the new main text 
(Rahlfs) will be listed from the Cambridge apparatus, along with 
whatever other information is available there. See I.3.11 for 
examples. 

     <h2>Default Attestation ("omn", "rell" or "rel").</> For the 
Cambridge apparatus, which is based on a relatively small number 
of representative manuscripts, the manuscript designations 
included in the default attestation "omn" and "rell" or covered 
by such listings as "a-d" (= abcd) have been filled out 
explicitly in the project file. Different procedures may be 
required with the Go%ttingen apparatuses, which cover a much 
larger range of MSS. 

     <h2>Versional Evidence.</> For the present, we have 
attempted to reproduce the versional information found in the 
respective apparatuses consulted. This material requires 
especially close scrutiny and will need extensive modification 
sometime in the future. The Cambridge editors tended to supply 
relatively full information for the Old Latin (OL), Syro-hexapla 
(OS), Armenian (OA) and Palestinian Aramaic (OP) versions. They 
were more selective with the Ethiopic (OE) and Coptic (OC) 
materials. In the Ruth variant file, the OL spelling as found in 
the Cambridge edition is sometimes standardized by use of 
parentheses (to fill in letters), OS transliterations follow the 
Hebrew coding employed by the project, and relatively certain 
Greek retroversions are sometimes noted in parentheses. More 
satisfactory treatment of most of the versional material, 
however, must await the results of specific studies (with 
computer assistance?) on each of the versions. 

     <h2>Quotations and Other Secondary Witnesses.</> For the 
present the information in the source apparatus attesting 
patristic quotations and related material is simply reproduced. 
As with the versions, much work needs to be done before this 
type of evidence can be evaluated adequately. The advent of 
computer assisted research encourages us to look for greater 
progress in these areas in the near future. 

     <h2>Other Ancient Greek Versions ("the Three," etc.).</> The 
format constructed for the project is sufficiently flexible to 
accommodate the inclusion of all ancient Greek variants, from 
whatever source. Thus we have not attempted to devise a separate 
apparatus for "the Three" (Theodotion, Aquila, Symmachus) and 
similar materials. Instead, the apostrophe (') is used to 
indicate these materials, enclosing the source designation on 
both sides ('t', 'a', 's', etc.) and the witness from which the 
information derives. A computer search of the file for any of 
these distinctive elements will enable the user to create an 
apparatus of these materials. 
 
 
<h1>9. Indicators of Uncertainty ("vid", "see", "?")</> 
 
     The apparatus reproduces the "vid" (= "apparently," but with 
room for doubt) notations in the Cambridge apparatus, but also 
adds other indicators of uncertainty: "see" is usually a term of 
cross reference and occurs especially in connection with 
versional material that has been broken into smaller units and 
often requires a consideration of the fuller versional context in 
order to determine what versional word(s) aligns with the Greek 
word; "?" is most often attached to a suggested reconstruction of 
versional material into Greek and warns the user that this is 
simply a suggestion (it is sometimes combined with "see" in such 
contexts). When "(?)" follows a MS designation, it simply 
reproduces the notation in the Cambridge apparatus; when it 
follows a versional siglum (OA, OC, OE, OL, OS), it usually is a 
warning to check the variant context carefully. In general, in 
these and in other occurrences, "?" is used as an indicator of 
doubt.
