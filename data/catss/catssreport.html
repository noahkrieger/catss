<h1>Computer Assisted Tools for Septuagint/Scriptural Study: 1995
Report to the National Endowment for the Humanities</h1>
<p><b>
COMPUTER ASSISTED TOOLS FOR SEPTUAGINT STUDIES</b> (RT-21083-89)
<p><b>        
Final Performance Report (UPDATE 12/31/94) 
</b><p>    
Because the project supported by this grant is essentially a 
continuation of an earlier funded project, this report will 
attempt to cover the entire project, with some attention to its 
various phases. Note that the project still continues, but 
without NEH funding.
<p>
During the previous grant periods (7/82 - 6/88) we accomplished 
the following, to which comments on more recent developments are 
appended in the "UPDATE" sections: 
<p>
(1) Establishment and Maintenance of <b>project offices</b> at the 
University of Pennsylvania (Philadelphia) and at the Hebrew 
University (Jerusalem). At Penn, the CATSS facilities have become a 
subset of the Center for Computer Analysis of Texts (CCAT), which 
coordinates such activities. Pertinent hardware at Penn includes an 
IBYCUS System H-P Minicomputer with four terminals (and a micro-
IBYCUS Scholarly Computer with CD-ROM reader that can serve as a 
fifth terminal, or as a stand-alone station), three types of 
printers (matrix, impact, and laser), tape drive, and a 404m disk 
drive. There is also an IBM terminal connected to the University's 
IBM mainframe and to the mini-IBYCUS System, with its own CD-ROM 
reader and printer accesses, and a  Kurzweil Data Entry Machine 
(KDEM) with its own tape drive. In Jerusalem, the project exchanged 
its PRIME computer diskpack for online access and equipment on the 
IBM system. 
<p>
<b>(UPDATE)</b> In the new grant period, the KDEM machine and some 
of the aforementioned IBM equipment have been upgraded 
(including, now, a Pentium level machine with CD-ROM reader), and 
an Apple Macintosh SE/30 work station with CD-ROM reader, HP 
scanner, HP Deskwriter printer, expanded internal memory and a 
40m hard disk has been added. This provides greater flexibility 
and efficiency in processing the relevant materials and in 
maintaining contact with work at Jerusalem and at other 
cooperating centers. In addition, the project now shares in the 
use of a RISC 6000 workstation, owned jointly by the Religious 
Studies and Classical Studies departments at Penn and focusing on 
the work of the Center for Computer Analysis of Texts. This 
provides the CATSS project with an added source of computing 
power and flexibility (running UNIX), as well as better contact 
with the worlds of the Internet. Some of the CATSS/CCAT texts 
have been mounted on that machine to facilitate Internet access 
(via Gopher or FTP), and use of the World Wide Web is providing 
even more visibility and distribution possibilities (see, e.g. 
<a href=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/rs/rak/kraft.html> Robert Kraft's
homepage</a>).
<p>
(2) <b>Training of graduate students and staff</b> to operate the 
equipment and assist with the goals of the project. This has 
included exchanges of student staffworkers between Jerusalem and 
Philadelphia, to the great benefit of all involved. It has also 
involved the development of formal courses on the application of 
computer technology to textual research. 
<p>    
(3) Aquisition, production, and distribution of the necessary 
<b>textual data for analysis and manipulation</b> by the project, and for 
scholarly research in areas related to the project interests. Most 
of the CATSS material available in summer 1987 has been included on 
the 1987 CD-ROM produced jointly by the Packard Humanities 
Institute and CCAT. This includes the Old Greek "Septuagint" text 
of Rahlfs, purchased from the TLG Project; the Hebrew "Masoretic" 
text of the Stuttgart edition, encoded under the direction of 
Richard Whitaker and Van Parunak at the University of Michigan 
(funded by the Packard foundation); the Latin "Vulgate" Stuttgart 
text, obtained from Tuebingen through the Oxford Archive; 
morphological analysis of the septuagintal materials, produced by 
CATSS-Penn; parallel alignment of the Hebrew and Greek texts, 
produced by the CATSS staff at the Hebrew University; and samples 
of the Greek textual variants, encoded by means of the Penn KDEM 
and reformatted and verified by CATSS-Penn (on CATSS products, see 
also below). A computer diskette containing samples of the CATSS 
materials has been distributed through the CCAT at Penn, along 
with diskettes of the biblical texts in Hebrew and Greek. The 
entire range of available data could also be obtained on tape from 
the CCAT at Penn and from the Oxford University Archive. 
<p>    
<b>(UPDATE)</b> The aforementioned 1987 PHI/CCAT CD-ROM has been 
sold out since mid-1990 and in 1991 the PHI Latin part of it was 
updated and put back into circulation, along with a selection of 
the more widely used biblical texts. Meanwhile, all of the CCAT 
texts on the original CD-ROM have been made available on 
diskettes (in corrected versions when necessary) and several new 
texts and/or tools have been added: e.g. the second half of the 
Hebrew-Greek aligned text, more of the Coptic Bible, a short 
Coptic-English Dictionary. Access to CATSS materials is also 
being provided now through the InterNet (FTP, Gopher, WWW). There 
are plans to produce a revised and updated "biblical" CD-ROM, 
independent of the PHI Latin, in the future. CCAT now has the 
capability of producing CD-ROMs on site. 
<p>
(4) Aquisition and development of the necessary <b>computer programs</b> 
to analyze and manipulate such materials. These include the 
powerful searching, sorting and editing features built into 
the IBYCUS Systems; David Packard's Greek morphological   
program package for the IBM mainframe; Richard Whitaker's 
Hebrew morphological program package developed for the project; 
John Abercrombie's programs for automatic alignment of the
Hebrew and Greek texts; programs for verifying and reformatting 
the automatically encoded Greek variants; programs for printing 
in Hebrew and Greek characters as well as English; programs for 
preparing data for CD-ROM storage and distribution; and various 
other programs, large and small, to facilitate various aspects
of the work.  
<p>   
<b>(UPDATE)</b> Much additional program development has taken place for 
accessing the CD-ROM from IBM/DOS microcomputers, often in 
cooperation with other developers. Packages of programs for the 
Macintosh have also been acquired (e.g. Pandora from the Perseus 
Project at Harvard, which has subsequently been marketed with CD-
ROM for Mac) or developed at Penn, including software for 
identifying and reconstructing fragmentary biblical (and other) 
papyri. File transfer between our three main systems (IBYCUS, 
IBM/DOS, and Macintosh), and to the international electronic 
networks (via the UNIX workstation with such features as FTP, 
Gopher, WAIS, Archie, Veronica, WWW, NetScape, and the like) is 
now reliable and commonplace. Other, non CATSS software 
developments of note include the COLLATE program for the Mac, by 
Peter Robinson at Oxford, who plans to adapt the program to 
accommodate the format in which CATSS has been processing the 
textual variants. 
<p>
(5) Complete <b>morphological analysis</b> for all of the Greek materials  
except the textual variants, and appropriate updating of the 
dictionaries for the MORPH program. David Packard's Greek MORPH 
program itself has been installed at Manchester University 
(England) for general use, and the analyzed Greek Jewish 
scriptures have been made available on the 1987 CCAT CD-ROM and 
by the other means noted above (tape, diskette, InterNet). 
<p>
<b>(UPDATE)</b> Extensive corrections to the Septuagint Morphological 
Analysis materials were made in Summer 1990, and the resulting 
files were released to distributors in December. Some errors and 
inconsistencies remain, but are currently being identified and 
corrected with the help of Bernard Taylor at Loma Linda CA (see 
the bibliography below). Meanwhile, the sister project for 
morphological analysis of the Hebrew text has been taken over by 
Westminster Theological Seminary, under the direction of Alan 
Groves, with various products and programs developed and 
distributed. 
<p>
(6) Complete <b>alignment of the base texts</b> in Greek and Hebrew. This
material continues to be corrected and modified in Jerusalem. 
A system for adding the Greek variants and morphological analysis 
to the aligned text has also been developed in Jerusalem. 
The entire parallel text is available to interested parties,
and the first half is included on the 1987 CCAT CD-ROM.  
<p>  
<b>(UPDATE)</b> The second half of this material was released on 
diskettes and tape in 1988. In Jerusalem, Galen Marquis has 
developed Macintosh based software to work effectively with the 
aligned and analyzed texts ("CATSS-Base"), using a data base 
management approach. Others have done similar things with the 
Macintosh "hypercard" program. For the IBM/DOS world, software 
called "LBase" (Linguists Base) has been developed by John Baima, 
in cooperation with CATSS/CCAT, to the same end. The Jerusalem 
team continues to verify and correct the aligned text, with 
updates provided periodically. 
<p>
(7) Encoding of <b>textcritical materials</b> for most of the Greek
Jewish scriptures. The main work is being done at Penn, although
certain books have also received attention elsewhere. The only
materials in completely final form by the end of the first major 
grant period were the books of Ruth and 1 Samuel. The main 
programs and procedures were in place for finishing this task, 
but considerable staff time would be needed. 
<p>
<b>(UPDATE)</b> This demanding aspect of the original project is still 
in progress. The books of Deuteronomy, 2 Samuel, Daniel, 
Canticles, Job (in its various textual forms), and some of the 
Minor Prophets, have reached the penultimate level of encoding 
and reformatting, and have been made available to interested 
parties for testing and comments. The remaining Minor Prophets, 
Genesis, Numbers, 2 Kings, 1 Esdras, Psalms, Wisdom, Sirach,
1-4 Maccabees, and Tobit are well along. Much of the rest has 
been scanned and reformatted in a preliminary manner but awaits 
the detailed editorial work needed to produce the desired 
consistency and quality for distribution. Meanwhile, the Text 
Encoding Initiative (TEI), has issued its recommendations for 
annotating textual variants (Kraft served on the TEI working 
group on textual variants), and the CATSS project looks forward 
to adopting those standards as its textual variant files are 
readied for general distribution and prepared for linking to the 
parallel text and morphological analysis materials. 
<p>
(8) High <b>visibility</b> through publications and publicity relating to 
the project. Project reports and updates have been presented  
regularly at the meetings of professional societies such as the 
International Organization for Septuagint and Cognate Studies, the 
Society for Old Testament Studies, and the Society of Biblical 
Literature, both in the USA and abroad. Project personnel have also 
reported to special symposia sponsored by the Delaware Valley 
Faculty Exchange and the Lehigh Valley Colleges (at Lafayette), as 
well as the Penn Alumni, and the project has been represented at 
various sessions of the World Conference of Jewish Studies 
(Jerusalem), International Association for Bible and Computer, and 
the twin humanities organizations, the Association for Computing 
and the Humanities and the (British based) Association for 
Literary and Linguistic Computing. At a more popular level, CATSS 
has received mention in articles in Discover Magazine, New York 
Times, Jewish Exponent, CD-Data Report, various religious 
publications, as well as in more local media. For fuller 
bibliographical information, see the appendix. 
<p>  
<b>(UPDATE)</b> Subsequent to the initial grant period, there has been 
no abatement of interest in the project, and representation on 
the Internet and at scholarly conferences continues apace. Kraft 
has helped to coordinate the information on computers and 
biblical studies for various projects and publications including 
his own OFFLINE columns for the Religious Studies communities and 
the Humanities Computing Yearbook (Oxford; ed Ian Lancashire). 
<p>
(9) Encouraged and contributed to the development of 
<b>international cooperation in computer assisted textual research</b> 
through regular contacts with individuals, projects and centers 
throughout this continent and the world at large. We have made it 
known that our materials are available to all interested scholars 
at cost, and have urged reciprocity. 
<p>    
In this connection, Robert Kraft has served as chair of the   
Computer Assisted Research Group of the Society of Biblical 
Literature, and until 1994 edited the "OFFLINE" computer 
information column in the Bulletin of the Council of Societies 
for the Study of Religion and in Religious Studies News, as well 
as distributing it first through relevant InterNet electronic 
discussion groups (such as HUMANIST, IOUDAIOS, RELIGION) and 
archiving it on the <a
href=gopher://ccat.sas.upenn.edu:70/11/journals/offline>CCAT
Gopher</a>. John Abercrombie, on behalf of 
CCAT, also edited a regular electronic mail column entitled 
ONLINE NOTES (BITNET) until about 1991. 
<p>
<b>(UPDATE)</b> The recent publication of part 1 of the Greek-English 
Lexicon of the Septuagint by Johan Lust et al., of Jos 
Weitenberg's parallel Greek / Armenian text of Jonah, and of 
Bernard Taylor's Analytical Lexicon to the LXX (see the 
bibliographical appendix, below) indicates that major cooperative 
byproducts from the project continue to appear, of which we 
expect to see many more. 
<p>
(10) Established a wider <b>base for continued funding</b> of the project 
and related work. In addition to the Universities directly involved 
in the work at Philadelphia and Jerusalem, funding has come 
especially from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Penn-
Israel Exchange Program, the Israel Academy of Sciences, the Jewish 
Publications Society, and the Packard Humanities Institute. Various 
other contacts have been made and continue to be explored. 
<p>
<b>(UPDATE)</b> Pursuit of funding has posed a major problem throughout 
the life of the project, especially since it often requires time 
and energy on the part of the Principal Investigator that could 
more usefully be put to the scholarly tasks of the project. Some 
income has been realized from distribution of texts produced by 
the CATSS project, either directly from CCAT or through a network 
of "secondary distributors" (including some CD-ROM products), but 
the continued pressures of needing to find matching and other 
funding often have proved to be counterproductive.
