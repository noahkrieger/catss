Information Update 14 Nov 2000 (RAK)

These notes need to be updated and recast, but provide a starting point
for understanding what has been done and who has been involved. Materials
began to be made available on the gopher in June 1994. Much of the most
recent work involved reformatting into an HTML type coding as well as
checking for accuracy.

Genesis (finished 10/2000 under the direction of Fritz Knobloch, with some
  final touchup envisioned) scanning finished 12/94 
  FK finished most of 1-25 (6/96), continued thereafter.            
Numbers (Patrick George disks to gopher 9/29/97; about half        
  finished; remainder needs integrating, etc.) G.Renberg 9/97      
Deut (Noel Hubler, Patrick George) [check end of file #1 ?]
  coding modified by Alan Lowenschuss 8/96; Gil Renberg 9/97

  where are the files?
2 Samuel (Patrick George [check for completeness])
  put on gopher 9/29/97
Ruth (from CD-ROM 1987)
  needs coding modifications [wrong file on gopher!]
1 Macc (Jackie Pastis) -- need text added to variants in both files, and
  the second file needs further checking.

  to Alan L for coding modifications 9/96                         
3 Macc (Mary LaRue)

**  = ready for Ibycus upload.  Correction 2 (final) by old status.
*   =  format 1 old status complete, files at various levels of verification.
k   = files that have been scanned, but not verified
$   = files needing to be scanned.
