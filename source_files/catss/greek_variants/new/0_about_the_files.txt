If you have trouble reading these files on line (for example, 
if they are all jumbled up), please use the following procedure. 

Instead of clicking on the name of the file, right-click (or on 
a Macintosh command-click) on the name of the file.  A 
contextual menu will appear which will allow you to save the 
file on your hard drive.  Then you can open it on your own system. 

The problem you're encountering is that web browsers ignore 
spacing and line breaks in text files.  When you download the 
file, you can easily open it as a text file.
